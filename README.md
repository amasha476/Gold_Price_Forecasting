## About The Project

This is a Python Flask application developed to get Gold Price Forecasts.
The project is based on the Time series analysis on Gold prices. 

## Techniques used
Python  LSTM, RNN, Flask, HTML & CSS For UI

### Dataset

Daily gold prices are collected from 2013-01-01 to 2023-09-29 from the Yahoo Finance Website.
The dataset consists of 3924 rows and 7 columns. 


### Model Fitting
LSTM Model is finalized as the best model to develop the application. The model is saved as a .h5 file to be used in the Flask application.

### Python Libraries used to develop the Application
The following Python libraries are used to create the gold price forecasting application.
